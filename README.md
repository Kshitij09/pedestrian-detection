# Pytorch Object detection models for Penn-Fudan dataset

> Structured implementation of pytorch object detection models for Penn-Fudan dataset. The project aims to make use of [pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) and [hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) to organize the codebase

_You can download the dataset from [Penn-Fudan Database for Pedestrian Detection and Segmentation](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/) website_

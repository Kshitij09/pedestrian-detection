# Pytorch Object detection models for Penn-Fudan dataset

> Structured implementation of pytorch object detection models for Penn-Fudan dataset. The project aims to make use of [pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) and [hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) to organize the codebase
